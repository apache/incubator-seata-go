## What is seata-go?

Apache Seata(incubating) is a very mature distributed transaction framework, and is the de facto standard platform for distributed transaction technology in the Java field. Seata-go is the implementation version of go language in Seata multilingual ecosystem, which realizes the interoperability between Java and Go, so that Go developers can also use seata-go to realize distributed transactions. Please visit the [official website of Seata](https://seata.apache.org/) to view the quick start and documentation.

The principle of seata-go is consistent with that of Seata-java, which is composed of TM, RM and TC. The functions of TC reuse Java, and the functions of TM and RM will be aligned with Seata-java later. The overall process is as follows:

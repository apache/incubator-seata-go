# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events for all branches and tags
on:
  push:
    branches: [ '**' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ '**' ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "lint"
